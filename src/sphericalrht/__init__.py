Spherical Rolling Hough Transform


A fast, efficient implementation of the Rolling Hough
Transform using spherical harmonic convolutions to
perform the algorithm directly on the sphere.

Classes:
    CubeAndStokes: Define an instance of this class with input
        parameters, then use the build_and_save method to run
        the algorthm.
    StokesQU: Handling Stokes linear polarization maps (only use
        if necessary).

Functions:
    set_logger: Log output in the terminal to a file (implemented
        within the CubeAndStokes class).
